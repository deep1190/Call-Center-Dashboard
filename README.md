# Call-Center-Dashboard
This repository contains the Call Center Dashboard project that I developed as part of the PwC Job Simulator. The dashboard is designed to provide real-time insights and analytics for a call center, helping managers and agents track performance and improve customer service.

Project Overview
The Call Center Dashboard project involved creating an interactive and data-driven dashboard that visualizes key metrics related to call center operations. The dashboard aims to enhance decision-making by providing a clear view of performance indicators such as call volume, average handling time, and customer satisfaction.

Key Features
Interactive Charts: Users can interact with various charts and graphs to explore data in more detail.
Performance Metrics: Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average handling time, call resolution rate, and customer satisfaction are prominently displayed.
Filtering Options: Filters are available to view data by time period, agent, or department.
